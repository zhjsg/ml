## I Neural Network

1. The order of working for Neural Network: 
```
A. The weighted sum of inputs is calculated
B. The Bias is added
C. The result is fed to an activation function
D. Specific Neuron is activated

In a neural network, each neuron in one layer is connected to other neurons in the corresponding layers. These connections carry random weights. The weighted sum of the inputs is calculated, and an additional input in the form of bias is added (w * x + b). The result of this is fed to an activation function. Based on a particular threshold value, only those neurons get activated that crosses the threshold value.
